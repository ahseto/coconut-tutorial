  <h1>Lazy Lists</h1>
  <h2>
    <p>
      Lazy lists are one of the fundamental aspects in Functional Programming because it allows us to define and create infinite lists. In Coconut, Lazy lists, represented by “banana brackets” (| |), are defined to be lazily evaluated iterator literals. This means that values are not stored in the list, but iterables are. Lazy evaluation is similar to the :: operator, in that expressions are not evaluated until that particular element is needed.
      <br><br>
      Let's apply lazy lists to the Fibonacci Sequence. Recall that the Fibonacci sequence is a series in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 ... We're using the Fibonacci series because the Fibonacci series is infinitely long, and recall that lazy lists are perfect for generate infinite lists.
